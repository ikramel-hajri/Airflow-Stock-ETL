Steps to Obtain the token.json File:

Create a Google Cloud Project:

Go to the Google Cloud Console.
Create a new project or select an existing project.
Enable Google Drive API:

In your Google Cloud project, navigate to the "APIs & Services" > "Library."
Search for "Google Drive API" and enable it for your project.
Create a Service Account:

In the "APIs & Services" > "Credentials" section, click on "Create credentials."
Select "Service Account Key."
Enter a name for the service account and assign the required roles, such as "Editor" or "Viewer," depending on the level of access you need.
Choose a role for the service account (e.g., "Service Account User").
Select "JSON" as the key type and click "Create" to generate the JSON key file.
Download token.json:

The JSON key file will be downloaded to your local machine.
This file is the token.json you will use for authentication in your code.
Ensure that you keep this token.json file secure, as it grants access to your Google Drive account. Do not share it publicly or expose it in your code repositories.
